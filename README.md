MPPT charger with LT3652 chip

MPPT charger board with LT3652 chip, is a stepdown battery charger that operates over a 4.95V to 32V input voltage range. It works perfectly for solar power based IOT applications. The LT3652 provides a constant-current/constant-voltage charge characteristic, with maximum charge current externally programmable up to 2A.  The charger employs a 3.3V float voltage feedback reference, so any desired battery float voltage up to 14.4V can be programmed with a resistor divider.
